SummaryQuality.csv summarises the quality of sensor readings and manual measurements for each of the measured samples.  Column headings are described below. If one of the values is missing, the cell will hold no value.
CollectionDate   — Date on which collection was taken.
Sample           — Number allocated to sample.  All samples from a specific date start with the same 2-digit number.
Gross Weight     — Weight of the bagged harvested material, including bag.
Net Weight       — Weight of the bagged harvested material, excluding bag.
Sanity Height    — Height of canopy, manually measured using meter stick
Dry%             — label. Percentage of matter by weight remaining after drying for 24 hours at 60 degrees Celsius. 
Brix1            — One of four brix readings taken from the harvested sample, on site.
Brix2            — One of four brix readings taken from the harvested sample, on site.
Brix3            — One of four brix readings taken from the harvested sample, on site.
Brix4            — One of four brix readings taken from the harvested sample, on site.
Nitro1           — One of six Nitrometer readings taken from the harvested sample, on site.
Nitro2           — One of six Nitrometer readings taken from the harvested sample, on site.
Nitro3           — One of six Nitrometer readings taken from the harvested sample, on site.
Nitro4           — One of six Nitrometer readings taken from the harvested sample, on site.
Nitro5           — One of six Nitrometer readings taken from the harvested sample, on site.
Nitro6           — One of six Nitrometer readings taken from the harvested sample, on site.
pre_Lidar        — LiDAR measurement from platform to canopy, before harvesting.
post_Lidar       — LiDAR measurement from platform to canopy, after harvesting.
diff_Lidar       — LiDAR measured difference in height, before and after harvesting.
Biomass          — label. Biomass extrapolated from weighed material to kg / ha. 
JAIRGB           — Average intensity of JAI RGB pixel.
JAIir            — Average intensity of JAI Infrared pixel.
GPSlong          — Sample longitude
GPSlat           — Sample latitude
ATemp            — Ambient temperature
CTemp            — Canopy temperature
